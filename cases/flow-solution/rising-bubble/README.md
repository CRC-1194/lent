# Rising bubble
Note: currently, only the three-dimensional variant is up-to-date and running

## Test background
[TODO: do some research if there exist any analytical solutions to compare with]  
[TODO: publicly available experimental data for comparison?]

## What can be tested
[TODO: write this section]

## Error metrics
This test case uses the _risingBubbleFunctionObject_ from the _two-phase-validation_
library [TODO: insert hyperlink] to evaluate the rise velocity of the bubble.

## Usage
Have a look at the README in the parent directory "flow-solution" to learn how to use
the hydrodynamic test cases.
